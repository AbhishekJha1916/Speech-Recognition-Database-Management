# Speech-Recognition-Database-Management
The aim of this program is to recognize voice and convert that input voice to text form. 
I have used Speech Recognition module of python to accomplish this mission, where recognizer.record() function does the hearing part and recognizer.recognize_google() function does the writing part of what it heard.  
There are modules like pyaudio which helps you to make use of system microphone. 
This phenomenon is a small example of Artificial Intelligence of speech recognition in Python.
